  abstract  = "Many real-world search and optimization problems are naturally posed as non-linear programming problems having multiple objectives. Due to the lack of suitable solution techniques, such problems were artificially converted into a single-objective problem and solved. The difficulty arose because such problems give rise to a set of trade-off optimal solutions (known as Pareto-optimal solutions), instead of a single optimum solution. It then becomes important to find not just one Pareto-optimal solution, but as many of them as possible. This is because any two such solutions constitutes a trade-off among the objectives and users would be in a better position to make a choice when many such trade-off solutions are unveiled.",

  abstract = {Visualizations depicting probabilities and uncertainty are used everywhere from medical risk communication to machine learning, yet these probabilistic visualizations are difficult to specify, prone to error, and their designs are cumbersome to explore. We propose a Probabilistic Grammar of Graphics (PGoG), an extension to Wilkinson's original framework. Inspired by the success of probabilistic programming languages, PGoG makes probability expressions, such as P(A|B), a first-class citizen in the language. PGoG abstractions also reflect the distinction between probability and frequency framing, a concept from the uncertainty communication literature. It is expressive, encompassing product plots, density plots, icon arrays, and dotplots, among other visualizations. Its coherent syntax ensures correctness (that the proportions of visual elements and their spatial placement reflect the underlying probability distribution) and reduces edit distance between probabilistic visualization specifications, potentially supporting more design exploration. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of PGoG in R.},
