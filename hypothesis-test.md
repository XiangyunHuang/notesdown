R. A. Fisher 将抽样分布、参数估计和假设检验列为统计推断的三个中心内容，可见假设检验的重要地位

呈现常见检验的公式，将手写代码和 R 内置函数计算结果进行比较，每一组原假设和备择假设要说明对应的 R 函数和及其参数设置，尽量理论和代码并重，最后结合实际的数据予以解释说明。

Jacob Cohen 实际谈的是更加深刻的问题。开篇介绍为什么需要假设检验，做检验和不做检验有什么区别？ 杨灿老师在[讨论帖](https://d.cosx.org/d/420930/11)提出检验的作用和实际应用问题

有了均值和方差，为什么还要位置参数和尺度参数？为了更一般地描述问题，扩展范围。

## Ansari-Bradley 检验 `ansari.test` {#sec:ansari-test}

Ansari-Bradley 检验目的是检验两样本的尺度参数是否有显著性差异

尺度参数可以理解为方差 $\sigma^2$

位置参数可以理解为均值 $\mu$


```r
usage(ansari.test)
ansari.test(x, ...)
usage("ansari.test.default")
## Default S3 method:
ansari.test(x, y, alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"), exact = NULL,
    conf.int = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95, ...)
usage("ansari.test.formula")
## S3 method for class 'formula'
ansari.test(formula, data, subset, na.action, ...)
```


## Bartlett 检验 `bartlett.test` {#sec:bartlett-test}

`ansari.test` 和 `mood.test` 是基于秩的两样本尺度参数显著性差异检验，是非参数检验

Bartlett 检验：检验各个组的方差是否有显著性差异，即方差齐性检验。

`var.test` 和 `bartlett.test` 都属于参数检验，用于检验方差齐性问题，前者考虑正态总体下方差齐性检验，后者没有对总体的分布形式做限定。


```r
usage(bartlett.test)
bartlett.test(x, ...)
usage("bartlett.test.default")
## Default S3 method:
bartlett.test(x, g, ...)
usage("bartlett.test.formula")
## S3 method for class 'formula'
bartlett.test(formula, data, subset, na.action, ...)
```

## 二项检验 `binom.test` {#sec:binom-test}

比例 $p$ 的检验， 做 $n$ 次独立试验，样本 $X_1,\ldots,X_n \sim b(1, p)$，事件发生的总次数  $\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i$   


函数 `binom.test` 用来检验伯努利试验中成功概率 $p$ 和给定概率 $p_0$ 的关系，属于精确检验。

编程手动实现一个，再调用函数计算，比较结果


```r
# 模拟一组样本
x <- sample(x = c(0, 1), size = 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.8, 0.2))
```

二项分布中成功概率的检验


```r
binom.test(sum(x), n = 100, p = 0.5)
```

```
## 
## 	Exact binomial test
## 
## data:  sum(x) and 100
## number of successes = 25, number of trials = 100, p-value = 5.636e-07
## alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.1687797 0.3465525
## sample estimates:
## probability of success 
##                   0.25
```

检验成功概率 p 是否等于 0.5， P 值 $6.148 \times 10^{-11}$ 结论是拒绝原假设


```r
binom.test(sum(x), n = 100, p = 0.2)
```

```
## 
## 	Exact binomial test
## 
## data:  sum(x) and 100
## number of successes = 25, number of trials = 100, p-value = 0.2118
## alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.2
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.1687797 0.3465525
## sample estimates:
## probability of success 
##                   0.25
```

检验成功概率 p 是否等于 0.2， P 值 0.7081 结论是不能拒绝原假设


二项检验 [@Test_1934_binom]


```r
usage(binom.test)

usage(Box.test)
```

```
Box.test(x, lag = 1, type = c("Box-Pierce", "Ljung-Box"), fitdf = 0)
```

## 皮尔逊卡方检验 `chisq.test` {#sec:chisq-test}

```


## 费舍尔精确检验 `fisher.test` {#sec:fisher-test}

固定边际的情况下，检验列联表行和列之间的独立性


```r
usage(fisher.test)
```

```
fisher.test(x, y = NULL, workspace = 2e+05, hybrid = FALSE,
    hybridPars = c(expect = 5, percent = 80, Emin = 1), control = list(),
    or = 1, alternative = "two.sided", conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95,
    simulate.p.value = FALSE, B = 2000)
```

## 方差齐性检验 `fligner.test` {#sec:fligner-test}

Fligner-Killeen (中位数) 检验各个组的样本方差是不是一致的，也是方差齐性检验

设随机变量 X 服从参数为 $p$ 的二项分布 $b(n, p)$， $Y$ 服从参数为 $\theta$ 的二项分布 $b(m,\theta)$， $m,n$ 都假定为较大的正整数，检验如下问题

$$
H_0: P_A \geq P_B \quad vs. \quad H_1: P_A < P_B
$$

根据中心极限定理

$$
\frac{\bar{X} - \bar{Y}}{\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n} + \frac{\theta(1-\theta)}{m}}}
$$
近似服从标准正态分布 $N(0,1)$。如果用矩估计 $\bar{X}$ 和 $\bar{Y}$ 分别替代总体参数 $p$ 和 $\theta$，构造检验统计量

$$
T = \frac{\bar{X} - \bar{Y}}{\sqrt{\frac{\bar{X}(1-\bar{X})}{n} + \frac{\bar{Y}(1-\bar{Y})}{m}}}
$$
根据 Slutsky 定理，检验统计量 $T$ 近似服从标准正态分布，当 $T$ 偏大时，拒绝 $H_0$。该方法的优势在于当 $n,m$ 比较大时，二项分布比较复杂，无法建立统计表，利用标准正态分布表来给出检验所需要的临界值，简便易行！

当 $p$ 和 $\theta$ 都比较小，上述方法检验效果不好，原因在于由中心极限定理对 $\bar{X}$ 和 $\bar{Y}$ 的正态分布近似效果不好，或者间接地导致 $\bar{X}-\bar{Y}$ 的方差偏小，进而 $T$ 的分辨都不好，而且当 $p,\theta$ 很接近 1 时，上述现象也会产生！

下面介绍新的解决办法

上面的检验问题等价于

$$
H_0: \frac{P_A}{P_B} \geq 1 \quad vs. \quad H_1: \frac{P_A}{P_B} < 1
$$

引入检验统计量 

$$
T^{\star} = \frac{\bar{X}}{\bar{Y}}
$$
同样由 Slutsky 定理和中心极限定理可知， $\bar{X}/\bar{Y}$ 近似服从 正态分布$N(1,\frac{1-\theta}{m\theta})$

当 $(T^\star - 1)/\hat\sigma$ 偏大时接受 $H_0$，临界值可通过 $N(0, \hat\sigma^2)$ 分布表计算得到， $\hat\sigma^2$ 是对 $\frac{1-\theta}{m\theta}$ 的估计，比如取 $\hat\sigma^2 = \frac{1-\bar{Y}}{m}\cdot \frac{1}{\bar{Y}}$ 或取 $\hat\sigma^2 = \frac{1-\bar{Y}}{m}\cdot \frac{1}{\bar{X}}$ 

由于渐近方差形如 $\frac{1-\theta}{m\theta}$，因而在 $\theta$ 较小，渐近方差较大，克服了之前 $\bar{X} - \bar{Y}$的方差较小的问题

$p,\theta$ 很接近 1 时，我们取检验统计量

$$
T^{\star\star} = \frac{1-\bar{Y}}{1-\bar{X}}
$$
结论和 $T^\star$ 类似，当 $T^{\star\star}$ 偏大时，拒绝 $H_0$。


两个二项总体成功概率的比较 [@Prop_2011_Song]


### 两个独立二项总体等价性检验 {#subsec:equivalent-test}

$H_0$ 成立的情况下，暗示着两个样本来自同一总体。在这种假设设置下，拒绝原假设是不是意味着接受备择假设？如何判断样本点会落在哪个拒绝域内呢？

<!-- 不要调用 **broom** 包的 `tidy()` 函数对 `prop_test` 计算结果进行整理，因为要引入新的依赖 -->

```
## 
## 	2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction
##

## X-squared = 31.632, df = 1, p-value = 9.315e-09

##  -1.0000000 -0.2237522
## sample estimates:
## prop 1 prop 2 
##    0.5    0.8
```

P 值 $9.315\times 10^{-09}$ 结论是拒绝原假设，并且接受备择假设，即 $P_A < P_B$，在原假设成立的情况下，样本落入拒绝域的概率很小，小于 0.05，即在一次实验中，样本不可能落入拒绝域，应当接受原假设，因为将备择假设设为

备择假设 $P_A > P_B$


```r
prop.test(x, alternative = "greater")
```

```
## 
## 	2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction
## 
## data:  x
## X-squared = 31.632, df = 1, p-value = 1
## alternative hypothesis: greater

##  -0.3762478  1.0000000
## sample estimates:
## prop 1 prop 2 
##    0.5    0.8
```

P 值为 1 不能拒绝原假设，在原假设成立的情况下，样本落入拒绝域的概率是 1


备择假设和原假设在这里是对立的关系


页面 A 观测到的点击率为 $50\%$ 页面 B 观测到的点击率为 $80\%$，设置检验问题

$$

Wilson 检验统计量 [@Test_1927_prop] 考虑单样本比例 $p$ 的区间估计问题，

Probable Inference (Usual): 可能的推断，或然推断，概率推断
  
在某个总体中抽取 n 个样本，观测到某个比率/频率 $p_0$，相应的标准差 $\sigma_0 = (p_0q_0/n)^{1/2}$，常见的概率推断表述是说：比率 $p$ 的真值落在区间 $[p_0 - \lambda\sigma_0, p_0 + \lambda\sigma_0]$ 外的概率小于等于 $P_\lambda$，并且随着 $\lambda$ 增大， $P_\lambda$ 减小。

如果使用 Tchebysheff 切比雪夫准则，我们知道 $P_\lambda$ 本身小于 $1/\lambda^2$，但是如果使用概率表 $P_\lambda$ 是概率密度曲线与坐标 $\pm\lambda\sigma_0$ 之外的部分围成的面积。尽管切比雪夫准则在估计 $P_\lambda$ 的时候过于保守，但是概率表给出了一个本质的估计。


严格来说，上面给出的概率推断的表述是简略的。真实概率$p$落在指定范围之外的机会要么是 0 要么是 1，就是说 $p$ 要么在那个范围要么不在那个范围。观测的比率 $p_0$ 有更大或更小的机会落在真实比率 $p$ 的某个区间。观测者运气不好，观测到一个相对罕见的事件发生了，基于已有的推断理论，他会获得一个相当宽的标记。

Probable Inference (Improved):

一个更好的方式来阐述推理过程：

有某个比率 $p$ 它的标准差是 $(pq/n)^{1/2} = \sigma$，一个观测糟糕如 $p_0$ 发生的可能性，即 $p_0$ 落在区间 $[p - \lambda\sigma,p + \lambda\sigma]$ 是小于等于 $P_\lambda$。

这个表述强调了特殊观测相对于一般典型情况更容易犯的错误。

lm 回归和 t 检验的差别，回归系数第二行， t 统计量为 -6.682，P 值为 2.92e-10，前者是因为截距项，后者是因为双边检验（模型系数显著性检验是和0比较），所以有2倍的关系。直观解释详见 [翻译：常见统计检验的本质都是线性模型（或：如何教统计学）](https://cosx.org/2019/09/common-tests-as-linear-models/)

两样本方差不齐、样本量严重不等，在大样本和小样本情况下的比较， [t 检验方差不齐有多重要](https://yihui.org/cn/2010/01/unequal-variance-in-t-test/)


#### 方差 $\sigma^2_1 / \sigma^2_2$ 已知

方差比 $c = \sigma^2_1 / \sigma^2_2$ 已知

#### 方差 $\sigma^2_1 / \sigma^2_2$ 未知

<!-- 样本量较小 -->

英国统计学家 William Sealy Gosset (1876-1937) 于 1908 年在杂志 《Biometrics》 上以笔名 Student 发表论文《The probable error of a mean》[@Students_1908_Gosset]，论文中展示了独立同正态分布的样本 $x_1, \ldots, x_n \stackrel{i.i.d}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ 的样本方差 $s^2$ 和样本标准差 $s$ 的抽样分布，根据均值和标准差不相关的性质导出 t 分布，宣告 t 分布的诞生，因其在小样本领域的突出贡献，W. S. Gosset 进入世纪名人录 [@Statisticians_2001_Heyde]

$$\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2(n-1)$$

$$\frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} \sim t(n-1)$$

$$E(s^2) = \sigma^2, \quad Var(s^2) = \frac{2\sigma^4}{n-1}$$

1. 两样本的样本量很大，总体方差未知，检验两样本均值的显著性检验，极限分布是正态，$u$ 检验
1. 两个样本的样本量不是很大，总体方差也未知，检验两样本均值的显著性检验，即著名的 Behrens-Fisher 问题，Welsh 在 1938 年提出近似服从自由度为 $\ell$ 的 t 分布。

wilcox.test(x, ...)
usage("wilcox.test.default")
## Default S3 method:
wilcox.test(x, y = NULL, alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),

### ROC 曲线和 wilcox.test 检验的关系 {#wilcox-test-roc}

<https://github.com/xrobin/pROC/wiki/FAQ---Frequently-asked-questions#can-i-test-if-a-single-roc-curve-is-significantly-different-from-05>

ROC 曲线越往左上角拱越好， AUC 是 ROC 曲线下的面积，所以 AUC 指标越接近 1 越好。

对每个标签的预测概率指定服从均匀分布，相当于随机猜测，所以最后 ROC 会接近对角线，而且样本量越大越接近，AUC 会越来越接近 0.5

[^order]: radix 排序翻译过来叫桶排序或基数排序，详细描述见 `?sort`

> 再往深一点就是研究一下 R 内置的排序算法，因为计算 AUC 最核心的步骤是排序。
`order` 函数默认的排序方法是 `auto` 即当数据量较小的时候，自动选择 radix 排序，当数据量比较大的时候，自动选择 shell 排序[^order]


```r
# 模拟一些数据
set.seed(2019) # 设置随机数种子
N <- 10^5 # 样本量
sim_dat <- cbind.data.frame(
  pred = runif(N),
  label = rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = 0.95)
)

# 计算 auc 的函数
# dat is a data.frame as input return AUC value
comp_auc <- function(dat, show_roc = TRUE) {
  # order label by predicted probability
  dat <- dat[order(dat$pred, dat$label, decreasing = TRUE), ]

  # total samples
  n_total <- length(dat$label)

  # number of positive label 1
  n_pos <- sum(dat$label)

  # number of negative label 0
  n_neg <- n_total - n_pos

  # calculate TPR and FPR
  tpr <- cumsum(dat$label) / n_pos
  fpr <- (1:n_total - cumsum(dat$label)) / n_neg

  # calculate auc
  auc <- 0
  for (i in 1:(n_total - 1)) {
    auc <- auc + (fpr[i + 1] - fpr[i]) * tpr[i]
  }
  # show ROC curve or not?
  if (show_roc) {
    plot(fpr, tpr, type = "l")
  }
  auc
}

comp_auc(dat = sim_dat, show_roc = FALSE)
```

模拟一个逻辑回归模型测试自编 AUC 计算程序和 R 包 pROC 计算结果


```r
set.seed(2018)
N <- 10^4 # 样本量
x <- rnorm(N)
beta_0 <- 0.5
beta_1 <- 0.3
eta <- beta_0 + beta_1 * x
# 模拟数据集
dat <- data.frame(x = x, y = rbinom(N, 1, prob = exp(eta) / (1 + exp(eta))))

# 数据集分隔
is_train <- sample(1:nrow(dat), N * 0.7)
train <- dat[is_train, ]
test <- dat[-is_train, ]
# 模型拟合
fit <- glm(y ~ x, data = train, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
# 预测
y_pred <- predict(fit, newdata = test, type = "response")

dat2 <- data.frame(pred = y_pred, label = test$y)
# 计算 auc
comp_auc(dat = dat2, show_roc = FALSE)
```

```
## [1] 0.5850287
```

对比 R 包 pROC 的计算结果是一致的


```r
pROC::auc(test$y, y_pred)
```

计算一下运行时间


```r
# 100 万样本
system.time(comp_auc(dat = dat2, show_roc = FALSE))
```

```
##    user  system elapsed 
##   0.002   0.000   0.002
```

更多关于 auc 计算的讨论见统计之都论坛帖 <https://d.cosx.org/d/419436>，我感觉这个问题最后会归结到排序问题。
